How to run :

You need to run `ng serve` to start the Angular development server & `npm run api` to
start the simulated JSON back-end

If I had more time I would implement :

Improved validation on forms, such as automatically appending decimals in the form input
Better typing
Avoiding use of non-null assertion
Currency i18n support
